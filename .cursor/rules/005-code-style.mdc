# Code Style Guidelines

## General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Add comments for complex business logic

## File Organization
- Group related functionality in appropriate directories
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports
- Separate concerns: components, utilities, types, etc.
- Follow the established project structure

## Error Handling
- Use proper error boundaries in React components
- Implement graceful error handling in API routes
- Use ZSAError for consistent error responses
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Performance Considerations
- Use React Server Components where appropriate
- Implement proper loading states
- Optimize database queries
- Use caching strategies with KV storage

## Package Management
- Before adding any new packages, always check if we already have them in `package.json` to avoid duplicates.
- Use `pnpm` for all package management operations.

## Code Quality
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Write type-safe code with proper TypeScript usage
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Implement proper testing strategies
